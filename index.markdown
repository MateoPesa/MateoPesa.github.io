## Welcome to my Portfolio!
## About Me:
My name is Mateo Pesa, a current junior at Cornell University studying Statistics with a concentration in Computational Statistics and Data Management. 

I am currently looking for oppportunities to apply my expertise in Data Science in a real world setting. 

## Past Projects:
- Predicting Victory Against 2022's Hardest Gaming Boss 
  - Description: This project focused on harnessing data from thousands of attempts against a formidable boss in the RPG video game Elden Ring. The objective was to construct predictive models that determine a character's likelihood of achieving victory.
