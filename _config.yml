# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This portfolio is a reflection of my journey in the world of data science. Here, you'll find a collection of projects and endeavors that showcase my skills and demonstrate my commitment to making data-driven solutions accessible and actionable. I've embraced various tools and methodologies to analyze, visualize, and interpret data, and I'm eager to apply these skills in real-world scenarios.
